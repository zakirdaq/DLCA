Are you an Avid Cricket Fan ? Always wanted to predict the D/L score before it is announced ? With Duckworth Lewis Calculator you can now calculate the required score using the D/L method for One-Day and T20 matches (both International and Domestic) in rain-struck matches with the ability to add multiple rain suspensions. You can compute the target and also find out which team wins if given their final scores.
The Duckworth Lewis method or D/L method is a set of formulas and tables created by Frank Duckworth and Tony Lewis. The method was adopted by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1999 to address the problem of delayed one-day cricket matches for reasons of rain, poor light and floodlight failures although it has also been used in events that have been shortened due to crowd problem, sandstorms and even snowstorms.

The calculator in this app is based on the Standard Edition of the calculations which are accurate for first innings scrores of up to 245, the resource table used is the most up-to-date as per the 2004 revision 2 duckworth/lewis ball-by-ball table. The Professional Edition and the newly release Stern Edition are made available by the ICC to the general public for free, hence this app does not support those editions.
